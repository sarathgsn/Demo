Imagine if your memory worked only while you were awake. Every morning when you got up, your mind would be completely blank! You'd have to relearn everything you ever knew before you could do anything. It sounds like a nightmare, but it's exactly the problem computers have. Ordinary computer chips "forget" everything (lose their entire contents) when the power is switched off. Large personal computers get around this by having powerful magnetic memories called hard drives, which can remember things whether the power is on or off. But smaller, more portable devices, such as digital cameras and MP3 players, need smaller and more portable memories. They use special chips called flash memories to store information permanently. Flash memories are clever—but rather complex too. How exactly do they work?


Ordinary transistors are electronic switches turned on or off by electricity—and that's both their strength and their weakness. It's a strength, because it means a computer can store information simply by passing patterns of electricity through its memory circuits. But it's a weakness too, because as soon as the power is turned off, all the transistors revert to their original states—and the computer loses all the information it has stored. It's like a giant attack of electronic amnesia!
