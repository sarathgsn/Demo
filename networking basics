Hub::
here are three things that switches do t
hat hubs do not: 
•
Hardware address learning 
•
Intelligent forwarding of frames 
•
Loop avoidance 



Layer-2 Forwarding Methods
Switches support three 
methods
 of forwarding frames. Each method copies 
all or part of the frame into memory, providing dif
ferent levels of latency 
and reliability. 
Latency
 is 
delay
 - less latency results in quicker forwarding. 
The 
Store-and-Forward 
method copies the 
entire
 frame into memory, and 
performs a Cycle Redundancy Check (CRC) to complete
ly ensure the 
integrity of the frame. However, this level of erro
r-checking introduces the 
highest latency of any of the switching methods. 
The 
Cut-Through (Real Time) 
method copies only enough of a frame’s 
header to determine its destination address. This i
s generally the 
first 6 bytes
following the preamble. This method allows frames t
o be transferred at 
wire 
speed
, and has the least latency of any of the three met
hods. No error 
checking is attempted when using the cut-through me
thod.
The 
Fragment-Free (Modified Cut-Through) 
method copies only the 
first 
64 bytes
 of a frame for error-checking purposes. Most colli
sions or 
corruption occur in the first 64 bytes of a frame. 
Fragment-Free represents a 
compromise between reliability (store-and-forward) 
and speed (cut-through).
