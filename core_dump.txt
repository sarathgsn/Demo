To set location of core dumps in Centos 6 you can edit /etc/sysctl.conf. For example if you want core dumps in /var/crash:

kernel.core_pattern = /var/crash/core-%e-%s-%u-%g-%p-%t

Where variables are:

    %e is the filename
    %g is the gid the process was running under
    %p is the pid of the process
    %s is the signal that caused the dump
    %t is the time the dump occurred
    %u is the uid the process was running under
