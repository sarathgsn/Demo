SYSLOG and KLOG and DMESG



/var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages: 
	general messages, as well as system-related information. Essentially, this log stores all activity data across the global system. Note that activity for Redhat-based systems, such as CentOS or Rhel, are stored in messages, while Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems are stored in Syslog.


/var/log/auth.log or /var/log/secure:
	 store authentication logs, including both successful and failed logins and authentication methods. Again, the system type dictates where authentication logs are stored; Debian/Ubuntu information is stored in /var/log/auth.log, while Redhat/CentrOS is stored in /var/log/secure.

/var/log/boot.log:
	 a repository of all information related to booting and any messages logged during startup.

/var/log/kern:
	 stores Kernel logs and warning data. This log is valuable for troubleshooting custom kernels as well.
var/log/dmesg:
	 messages relating to device drivers. The command dmesg can be used to view messages in this file.


    /var/log/daemon.log: tracks services running in the background that perform important tasks, but has no graphical output.
    /var/log/btmp: recordings of failed login attempts
    /var/log/utmp: current login state, by user
    /var/log/wtmp: login/logout history
    /var/log/lastlog: information about the last logins for all users. This binary file can be read by command lastlog.
    /var/log/pureftp.log: runs the pureftp process that listens for FTP connections. All connections, FTP logins, and authentication failures get logged here.
    /var/log/spooler: rarely used and often empty. When used, it contains messages from USENET.
    /var/log/xferlog: contains all FTP file transfer sessions, including information about the file name and user initiating FTP transfers.


syslog contains all the messages except of type auth.
klog and dmesg are same , but klog and syslog are diffrent






dmesg prints the contents of the ring buffer. This information is also sent in real time to syslogd or klogd, when they are running, and ends up in /var/log/messages; when dmesg is most useful is in capturing boot-time messages from before syslogd and/or klogd started, so that they will be properly logged.
