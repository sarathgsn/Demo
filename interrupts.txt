Asynchronous interrupts are generated by Hardware
Synchronous interrupts are generated by processor.
Each device that generates interrupts has an associated interrupt handler.

Each device that generates interrupts has an associated interrupt handler.
for system timer one function handles the interrupts;
for keyboard there is seperate function handles the interrupts.


the interrupt handler for a device is a part of the device's driver:

difference between interrupt handler functions and normal kernel functions is that the kernel will invoke them  in response to interrupts and they run in a special context is called interrupt context:

this special context is occasionally called ATOMIC context because , the code is excuting in this context is unable to blockable.




top Halves Vs Bottom halves:

( Excute quickly and perform large amount of work)
