An ELF header resides at the beginning and holds a "road map'' describing the file's organization. 
 
Sections hold the bulk of object file information for the linking view: instructions, data, symbol table, relocation information,

A 
program headertable, if present, tells the system how to create a process image. Files used to build a process image (execute a program) must have a program header table; relocatable files do not need one. A section headertable contains information describing the file's sections. Every section has an entry in the table; each entry gives information such as the section name, the section size, and so on. Files used during linking must have a section header table; other object files may or may not have one.
